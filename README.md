<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I wanted to practice basic scene loading and 2D Game Development in Unity. However, I wanted the concept to be interesting while the scope to be not very broad. Therefore I went with creating a number guessing game in Unity on the idea of Number Wizard! 

Here's why:
* I believe the concept makes sense for the guessing game. It is much more fun to play than a program that outputs the result of the random number generator into the console.
* It inherently opens only a few end scenes for the player, so it is great for this scope of the project.
* One should focus on their 2D "game" as well. After all, it is a good way to start since you don't also deal with the complexity of Unity while learning the 3D space. Foundations are very important :smile:

Of course, this game is just a stone in the wall I am building that represents my Unity journey. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks for your interest; even reading the READme means a lot!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Unity](https://unity.com)
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You don't need a lot of steps to run the game. Just Unity engine, but for sure you need a lot of space because Unity engine is the reason why I had to give up on some of my dreams. It literally, with Windows, would eat all of your SSD space. So goodbye Photoshop, I guess no Adobe Programs for me! So if one, like me, accepted this harsh truth, they can access the enjoyment of this otherwise beautiful engine.

### Prerequisites

You need Unity 2020( any variant) or greater to run this game without any issues. I recommend using Unity Hub for ease of use.
* Unity
  ```to install
  https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive
  ```

### Installation

1. Install Unity 2020 or higher version [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/orhanar/Number-Wizard.git
   ```
3. Go to Unity Hub
   ```
   Click create new and select the path you cloned the repo
   ```
4. Launch the game
   

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can use this game to create new game concepts that use multiple linear level designs. Level loader logic is there. It is also a great resource to have for checking how buttons work in Unity.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html)_
